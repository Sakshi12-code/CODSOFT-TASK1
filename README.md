**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**

A password generator project is a software tool designed to create secure, random passwords based on specified criteria.<br/>
The primary purpose of such a project is to help users generate strong, unpredictable passwords to enhance the security of<br/>
online accounts, applications, or systems. Here's an overview of the key components and features that a password generator<br/>
project typically includes:<br/>

**1. Core Functionality**<br/>
Random Password Generation: The central feature is the ability to generate a password that is random and hard to guess.<br/>
This is usually done by combining different types of characters in unpredictable patterns.<br/>
Character Sets: The password generator often allows users to include or exclude different types of characters, such as:<br/>
Uppercase Letters (A-Z)<br/>
Lowercase Letters (a-z)<br/>
Digits (0-9)<br/>
Special Characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, &, etc.)<br/>
**2. Customization Options**<br/>
Password Length: Users can specify the length of the password, typically ranging from short passwords (8-10 characters) to more<br/>
secure,longer ones (16-64 characters).<br/>
Character Composition: Users can choose which types of characters to include. For instance, they might exclude special characters or only include digits.<br/>
Avoid Ambiguous Characters: Some password generators offer an option to avoid ambiguous characters (e.g., O vs 0, l vs 1) for readability.<br/>
**3. Additional Security Features**<br/>
Password Strength Indicators: The tool may include a meter to indicate the strength of the generated password based on the length and character variety.<br/>
Entropy Calculation: Entropy is a measure of unpredictability. A password generator might show the entropy of the generated password, indicating how secure it is.<br/>
No Password Reuse: Some generators may ensure that newly generated passwords are different from those previously generated.<br/>
**4. User Interface**<br/>
GUI (Graphical User Interface): A password generator might offer a simple user interface with buttons and options for selecting the desired password features.<br/>
CLI (Command Line Interface): For developers or technical users, a password generator may be designed as a command-line tool with options provided via command flags.<br/>
**5. Security Considerations**<br/>
No Data Storage: Passwords should not be stored or transmitted in any form to ensure privacy.<br/>
Open-source Algorithms: A strong password generator often uses well-established, open-source algorithms to ensure the randomness and unpredictability of the generated passwords.<br/>
Encryption (optional): Some generators may allow users to encrypt their passwords or securely store them using encryption techniques.<br/>

**TECHNOLOGIES USED:** <br/>

**1. Programming Languages** <br/>
Python: Often used for building simple command-line or GUI-based password generators due to its easy syntax and rich libraries like random and secrets.<br/>

**2. Libraries & APIs**<br/>
Python's random or secrets Module: Used for generating random sequences securely in Python.<br/>
